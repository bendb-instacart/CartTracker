# Privacy Policy

## Personal Information

Our policy is quite simple - we do not collect or store any data about any of our users.

## Analytics

We do not collect any kind of data on app usage, either individual or in aggregate.

## Crash Reporting

If the CartTracker app crashes, we may prompt users to submit a crash report the next time the app starts.  The crash report contains information about the computer where the crash occurred but does not include personal identifying information. Crash reports are used to resolve the software bug that caused the crash.
